    # marked iscompressed: in the RTL ELF such a slot is emitted as a packed
    # (compressed_instr | c.nop) pair, while in the spike-resolution ELF the
    # same slot is emitted as the full uncompressed 32-bit form
    # (see _emit_slot_bytecode in genelf.py). The two byte sequences differ,
    # so loads landing on these slots return divergent values between the two
    # runs — which in turn corrupts placeholder-consumer rdep values and can
    # produce, e.g., misaligned load addresses at runtime.
